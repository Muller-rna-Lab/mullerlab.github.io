	<h2 class="indent_h2">Ferenc Mueller</h2>
	<p class="labtxt"> I did my PhD as PhD fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at the Inst. of Molecular Genetics, ABC Godollo in 1996. Following post docs at the University of Southampton and the IGBMC Strasbourg (EMBO Fellow) I started my independent research at the Inst. Toxicology and Genetics, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (currently KIT) in 2001. In 2007 I became Senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham, where I am Professor of Developmental Genetics since 2014. My research interests encompass transcription regulation in vertebrate development and deciphering the DNA codes of gene expression regulation. I use zebrafish as a main model system. Besides leading a research group, I teach in medical genomics and various applied genetics courses and work as Deputy Director of Research for the College of Medical and Dental Sciences.</p>

	<h2 class="indent_h2">Joseph Wragg</h2>
	<p class="labtxt"> I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the field of developmental and cancer epigenetics, with a particular interest in embryo development and vascular biology.

I originally read Biology at the University of York, before studying for a doctorate in Cancer Research at the University of Birmingham with Professor Roy Bicknell (awarded 2016). In this post I developed a fascination in tumour associated vascular as a critical component of tumour development and potentiation and as a target for therapy and identified several tumour vascular specific markers, which are currently in clinical development.

My current research, with Professor Ferenc Mueller is focussed on interrogating dynamic epigenetic changes occurring on enhancer and promoter gene regulatory elements, during embryonic and tumour development, using Cap Analysis of gene expression (CAGE), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) as well as 4D imaging approaches.

	<h2 class="indent_h2">Lucy Wheatley</h2>
	<p class="labtxt"> I am a post-doctoral fellow with the Mueller group since 2017 with a keen interest into the mechanisms of transcription in the early zebrafish embryo.  Using fluorescent labelling of DNA, RNA and epigenetic marks I am visualising the expression of the first zygotic genes, to understand some of the key underlying principals that govern transcriptional regulation in vertebrates.  I have a background in profiling small and transient cell populations from the developing zebrafish and using CRISPR-Cas9 systems to target specific genetic modifications.</p>

	<h2 class="indent_h2">Ada Jimenez-Gonazalez</h2>
	<p id="espanol" class="labtxt"> I studied veterinary medicine in the Canary Islands. As an undergraduate I was involved in the research of the immune response triggered by parasitic infections in goats. In 2011 I did my Master’s degree in the University of Salamanca where I also received my PhD in neurosciences in 2016. My PhD research focused in the effects of opioids in the development of the central nervous system in zebrafish. Then I moved to work as a postdoc in the Mueller lab in 2017. 
My main interest is developmental epigenetics and I’m currently involved in the transgenerational epigenetics project. Here we are trying to unravel how paternal experiences can affect the posterior generations through the inheritance of epigenetic marks. My experiments include lots of ChIP, cas9 manipulation and in situ hybridization, among others.

	<p class="labtxt"> I am a PhD student who joined the laboratory in early 2017, although I also did my Masters within the Mueller lab in 2016. My main area of interest is
	in developing and implementing computational methods for identifying and tracking fluorescently tagged nucleear structures within the developing zebrafish embryo. I also use electrophysiology to
	apply genetic imaging molecules into living tissues. During my Masters and Bachelors degrees, I focussed on utilising electrophysiological methods in
	<i>in/ex vivo</i> models. I also spent some years working as a Data Scientist in the NHS. (I also put together this website)
